# Smart Billing Calculator

🔗 **Live App:**  
https://sameer-dev-106.github.io/smart-billing-calculator/

A mobile-first smart billing calculator built for small shopkeepers.

This app solves the biggest problem of normal calculators:  
you cannot verify what items were added to reach the final total.

Smart Billing Calculator separates calculation and billing so every shopkeeper  
can confidently generate a correct and transparent bill.

## 🧠 What this app does

Normal calculators only show one final number.  
In real shops this causes:
- mistakes  
- confusion  
- arguments  
- no way to verify the bill  

Smart Billing Calculator fixes this by:
- tracking each entered value as a bill item  
- using a real calculator engine internally  
- showing a full bill before printing  
- supporting previous balance (pehle ka) and payment (jama)  
- preventing accidental actions using confirmation popups  
- saving bills and calculations locally for reference  

---

## 📱 App Flow

### 1️⃣ First Time Setup
User enters shop name, which is saved permanently on the device.

---

### 2️⃣ Calculator Mode
User enters numbers like a real physical calculator.

The screen shows:
- live expression  
- running total (Kul Rakam)  
- item count  

Totals update naturally as operators are used,  
just like calculators used in real shops.

Decimal input is handled intelligently.  
If the user starts with a dot (`.`), the calculator automatically converts it to `0.`.

---

### 3️⃣ Calculator History
After pressing `=`, each calculation is saved automatically.

- History shows expressions like `20+30-10`  
- Final result is clearly visible  
- History opens in a dedicated modal  
- Old calculations can be restored back into the calculator  
- History can be cleared safely with confirmation  

This helps users quickly reuse or verify calculations.

---

### 4️⃣ Safe Finalization
- Pressing `=` asks for confirmation before finalizing the calculation  
- Accidental key presses do not lock the bill  
- Users are clearly informed before starting a new bill  

---

### 5️⃣ Create Bill
When user clicks **Bill**, a form opens asking:
- Customer Name (required)  
- Pehle ka (optional)  
- Jama (optional)  

Billing is blocked unless calculation is finalized correctly.

---

### 6️⃣ Item Name (Optional but Recommended)
Before generating the final bill, the user is asked to optionally  
add names for each bill item.

- Each calculated item is shown with its amount  
- User can enter item names in a dedicated screen  
- Additional items can be added if required  
- Items can be skipped safely with clear confirmation  
- Default item names are applied automatically if skipped  

This ensures clean bills without forcing extra work.

---

### 7️⃣ Bill Mode (Read-Only)
The app shows a receipt-style bill with:
- shop name  
- date and time  
- customer name  
- item list (item name, operator, value)  
- total amount  
- previous balance  
- payment  
- final balance  

🔒 **Important Design Decision**  
The bill screen is **read-only** to prevent accidental changes.  
Items cannot be edited or deleted once the bill is generated.  
Only “Pehle ka” and “Jama” are considered editable before finalization.

---

### 8️⃣ Bill History
Every finalized bill is saved automatically.

- Bills are stored locally on the device  
- Bill History opens as a separate screen  
- Each entry shows customer name, date, and final amount  
- Old bills can be reviewed anytime  
- Bills are locked to prevent accidental changes  

---

## 🌐 Language Support

The app supports:
- Hindi  
- Hinglish  
- English  

Language can be changed from the Settings screen.  
The selected language is saved in localStorage.

---

## 🎨 Theme Support

The app supports manual theme control for better usability in different environments.

Available modes:
- **System** – follows the device theme automatically  
- **Light** – forces light mode  
- **Dark** – forces dark mode  

The selected theme:
- applies instantly  
- is saved in localStorage  
- is restored on page reload  

---

## 💾 Data Storage

The app uses localStorage to save:
- Shop name  
- Selected language  
- Selected theme  
- Bill history  
- Calculator history  

Calculator resets for new bills,  
but history remains available for reference.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- HTML  
- CSS  
- Vanilla JavaScript  
- LocalStorage  

This version is planned to be converted into React later.

---

## 🔒 Item Validation & Safety

- Blank items are visually highlighted with error animation
- Bill generation is blocked until validation passes
- This ensures no blank or zero-value bills are generated accidentally

---

## 🔐 Open Source, Product-First Approach

This project is open source to support learning, transparency, and collaboration.

However, Smart Billing Calculator is being developed as a real, shop-ready product,
not just a demo or tutorial project.

The public repository represents the open version of the app.
Product decisions, UX improvements, and future features
are driven by real user feedback and continuous iteration.

Forking for learning and experimentation is welcome.
Commercial redistribution without meaningful contribution
goes against the spirit of this project.
