# Smart Billing Calculator

A mobile-first smart calculator built for shopkeepers and daily billing use.
Instead of just showing a final total, this calculator helps track items,
verify calculations, and generate a simple bill view.

## 🚀 Features

- Calculator mode for fast calculations
- Bill mode with item list and totals
- Item count tracking
- Reload-safe using localStorage
- Hinglish and English language support (planned)
- Mobile-style calculator UI
- Designed for real shop use cases

## 🧠 Why this project?

Normal calculators only show the final number.
In shops, it becomes difficult to verify:
- how many items were added
- which values were included
- whether the total is correct

This project solves that problem by separating:
- calculation flow
- final bill verification

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- LocalStorage

## 📱 UI Inspiration

Inspired by mobile calculator apps and real-world shop billing flow.

- JavaScript logic in progress

Future plans:
- React version
- Bill history
- Export / share bill
- PWA offline support
